## Ideation
The journey began on 23th November with a [pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kv7alR1M256GV8CFDEPTV7s6HCyVCX720KRR_hB0FFY/edit?usp=sharing) by Steffi and Matze - we are _team UX_. Shortly after, we started with ideation - full of discussion, brainstorming and sticky-note-sticking. Have a look into our [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkqmKh4=/?invite_link_id=394830715163).

In cooperation with team DS and WD, and of course our mentors, we defined and agreed on a [MVP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C3kZdJfDWGIoulk4k2I1zuaZAbnfEHos/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115864974634270890433&rtpof=true&sd=true). The need and the core idea of _Commfy_ was underlined by the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKcrIzC8nJBydJe6Nq81hIt8z1BXpPpX__HiZKTKPPWkIoDg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Please see the [results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uZI5itwwMY4735e107FizCzo3BJAZWf9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115864974634270890433&rtpof=true&sd=true) and survey result [presentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uQudUUu7LqKu8h-HtU6bsaMusSTcCGL0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115864974634270890433&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Content and Structure
With an idea of MVP and a vision of _Commfy_ in our head we worked on the content ([IA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wLyY9dQ8Mcu2deTNHrrSg2vltHNFKujc/view?usp=sharing)) and the structure of the digital product ([sitemap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_3pkXDHU-fAZhmtw6eNgJei4ubyX55MD/view?usp=sharing)), always in mind - our [persona Marena](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zx_mIMjo1sDYbCisViNUyBzF4jQoZGXM/view?usp=sharing). She guided and supported our decisions and helped focusing on the core ideas.

## Low fid wireframe
Now we had to work ourselves into Figma, creating the [screens](https://www.figma.com/file/AMufB70YKpozWv97L53Pw5/Low-fid?node-id=0%3A1) in low fid quality and the corresponding [click-trough wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/AMufB70YKpozWv97L53Pw5/Low-fid?node-id=101%3A19&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=101%3A19). So we were ready to start the user tests, which were the biggest source of learning and improvement in the whole process. The insights were stunning and demonstrated how import an early integration of users in the process of product development is. We improved the product iteratively based on the [userÂ´s feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYegcY2dq-y_dF3UrfLVG-TLItvvV_AY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115864974634270890433&rtpof=true&sd=true) and as soon as possible. Consequently, we were able to test the changes already with the next user.

Do you remember our awesome [mid term presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C35J6dVIcpAc8YwQpFnQhn9mYoWbymNDh8Se0tszXzc/edit?usp=sharing)?

## High fid wireframe
As time was running, we directly threw ourselves into the [high fid](https://www.figma.com/file/jiG70bLh91OgpRiX5zwE2S/High-fid?node-id=126%3A3346) wireframing, using components of our own little project library. As we were now new members in the "love-user-test-fanclub" we built up a [click-through wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/jiG70bLh91OgpRiX5zwE2S/High-fid?node-id=126%3A3347&scaling=scale-down&page-id=126%3A3346&starting-point-node-id=126%3A3347&show-proto-sidebar=1) and - again - engaged in [user tests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-D0B1vlPgGQGz_jvYqBYzv3bz_FkjQI-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115864974634270890433&rtpof=true&sd=true) to get the latest changes, details and designs approved.
