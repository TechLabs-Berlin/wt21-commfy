_Commfy_ is a digital product that fundamentally changes how bike commuters make their cycling clothing decisions. Through data-driven recommendations, the application ensures that users wear the right clothes every time they ride their bikes, even in changing weather conditions. Automated and enhanced apparel selection takes the personal commuter experience to a new level, allowing users to focus on what matters most to them truly. Hence, _Commfy_ transforms bike commuting, making it more convenient, easier, and safer.

The application outputs suitable clothing recommendations for relevant layers based on a validated & data-driven recommendation model. It integrates various data inputs, including weather data of users’ locations, perceived route properties, and individual characteristics.

A solid backend stores, connects, and updates live data and model predictions, which are then visualized in carefully curated and skillfully assembled mobile front-end designs.

Commuters engage with _Commfy_ through an intuitive, lean, yet responsive user interface based on intensive user-testing and deliberate design work. The application can be extensively customized to individual needs. Key features of _Commfy_ include:

* Suggestions for packing an item of additional clothing in a backpack. Never again will users be surprised by a rain shower!
* Opportunity to define routes, resulting in comprehensive daily & timed routes.
* Ability to define personal heat preference to get customized clothing recommendations.
* Possibility to provide quantitative feedback on clothing recommendations to improve model’s performance each time the app is used.

The _Commfy_ project is a joint effort by students from User Experience Design, Web Development and Data Science tracks. In an agile, autonomous way of working, with open communication and great joy, the interdisciplinary team conceived, designed, and implemented a product from scratch within 8 weeks. Thanks for that ride, team _Commfy_!
