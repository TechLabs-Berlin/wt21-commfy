# wt21-commfy
_Commfy_ is a digital product that fundamentally changes how bike commuters make their cycling clothing decisions. Through data-driven recommendations, the application ensures that users wear the right clothes every time they ride their bikes, even in changing weather conditions. Automated and enhanced apparel selection takes the personal commuter experience to a new level, allowing users to focus on what matters most to them truly. Hence, _Commfy_ transforms bike commuting, making it more convenient, easier, and safer.
<br><br>The project was realized in TechLabs` Winter Term 2021/2022.<br><br>
