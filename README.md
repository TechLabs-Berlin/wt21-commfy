# Commfy

Commfy is a digital product that fundamentally changes how bike commuters make their cycling clothing decisions daily. Through data-driven recommendations, the application ensures that users wear the right clothes every time they ride their bikes, even in changing weather conditions.

The project was realised during the TechLabs Winter Term 2021/2022.
